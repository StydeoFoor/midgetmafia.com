    <h3>No NSFW Content</h3>
    <p>No NSFW content is allowed on this website, you will be muted and possibly banned if this happens</p>
    <h3>Follow Staff instructions</h3>
    <p>Follow what the Owners and Leaders say, we know what we are doing</p>
    <h3>We respect Copyright Law</h3>
    <p>Even though this is unnecessary, since 9.9/10 of us do not own copyrighted content, we do respect copyright law and will remove content that is yours if asked, we do ask that you tell us to remove it, not just send us a demand to shut down the website</p>
    <h3>Poke Around and Find Out</h3>
    <p>By accessing this website, whether authorized or not, you acknowledge and accept that any and all experimental, beta, and security-related features may be applied to your session when we please. This includes interactive simulations, scare tactics, and other disruptive mechanisms intended for security purposes. We don't care if you like it or not.</p>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>What you say, stays</h3>
    <p>Messages you send/delete are logged in the system, we still see it, and if we suspect you are breaking rules, we can, and will, search through your messages</p>
    <h3>Here is whats stored and whats not</h3>
    <p>To be transparent, nearly everything you put on this site is stored, passwords, usernames, messages, everything, but don't worry, we have security to make sure no one hacks their way through, however, if you wish for your account information, messages, or other things to be deleted, then we can do that, and we will make sure nothing of yours stays.</p>
    <h3>Your things are as secure as we can keep them</h3>
    <p>Security Updates are pushed out often, and every flaw is accounted for. Not a single thing is ignored.</p>
    <h2>Devs are not mini mods</h2>
    <p>There are some problems that Mason and the Devs simply cannot solve, and for security reasons, so if there is an issue we ask that you contact Staff about it, not the developers</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Too Long or Didn't Read</h2>
    <p>No NSFW content, follow staff instructions, and we can use our security system, whether tame or not, whenever we want.</p>
