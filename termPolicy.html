    <h2>Note before reading: "Access Null" refers to a group lead by Deleted User, it also refers to the group of MM developers</h2>
    <h1>Terms of Service:</h1>
    <p>In order to use the website fairly, there are boundaries to be set, so to put it simply, these are the rules you have to follow</p>
    <h3>No NSFW or inappropriate content</h3>
    <p>We ask that you do not message users or message into the chatrooms we provide any content MM deems inappropriate for teenagers</p>
    <h3>No hacking or leaking personal information</h3>
    <p>Users can and will be banned if they hack other users accounts with the intent of reading private DMs, messing with Admin rooms, etc.</p>
    <h3>Your messages are logged</h3>
    <p>If you do not wish to use the messaging services, thats fine, but just keep in mind that if you choose to, your messages can and will be used against you should you be apart of an ongoing trial</p>
    <h3>Copyright Notice</h3>
    <p>The Access Null respects copyright law and if you feel your rights are infringed, we may take down certain elements of the website under the rare circumstance you happen to own any copyrighted content on the website, we can and will take it down if you have proof that you own the copyright in question</p>
    <h3>You won't get everything upon login</h3>
    <p>Everything made in the MM website was tailored to the owner's demands, if you feel you should be allowed access, do not discuss such matters with the Access Null or any of the MM developers, discuss that with the leader, not us</p>
    <h1>Privacy Policy:</h1>
    <h3>We can and may change logins and passwords</h3>
    <p>If you feel like your password or username should be changed, you may discuss such matters with Access Null, we can change your logins and username only, not your roles or anything else</p>
    <h3>Your data is as secure as we can keep it</h3>
    <p>Throughout MM development, it's become clear that passwords and usernames were visible to members and owners, although, we have patched that, and all other signs of personal information going public.</p>
    <h3>Thats it!!</h3>
    <h1>Another addition I want to make, elevated privledges does not mean elevated rules</h1>
    <p>If you have elevated access to the MM websites, like developers, owners, and other roles, you still have the same rules as everyone, if not more considering admin misconduct, and other admin rules, you don't own the website, we do, so what we say, 7 times out of 10, goes.</p>
