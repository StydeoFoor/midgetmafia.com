  <h1>GTA VI Damage Control</h1>
  <p>Most people are highly concerned about PC requirements for GTA VI, but I want to step in for damage control for MM members who have PCs of their own.</p>
    <p>I'll explain the facts here.</p>
    <br>
    <p>GTA VI on the PS5 is locked at 30 FPS, which may have people concerned, but one thing to mention is that the target audience of people with PS5s have 48 to 55 inch TVs, which are set at 1440p or 4K (however, some are set at 1080p)</p>
    <p>A graphics card works by coloring each pixel on a screen. Filling up that many pixels with such specific colors to display GTA VI’s graphics is difficult, but things like PC monitors, which are 24 to 27 inches and typically set at 1080p, should do perfectly fine at 60 FPS, which is considered normal</p>
    <p>The reason Rockstar locked it to 30 FPS is that the graphics card and processor, which are considered midrange for computers, simply are not good enough to display the graphics on a 4K TV</p>
    <p>However, this all assumes you have a 1440p or 4K monitor. If you have a 1080p TV, then performance isn’t an issue, but since its a bigger screen, you may see some issues. If it’s a monitor, you should be fine.</p>
    <p>If you have a 1440p or 4K monitor, you will have much more trouble, as these monitors are part of why the PS5 was locked at 30 FPS to begin with</p>
    <br>
    <h3>FINAL VERDICT</h3>
    <p>To the PC members who have midrange to high-end PCs, you should have no issue playing GTA VI on a 24-inch monitor at a stable 60 FPS. If you want higher frame rates like 144 FPS, it might be time to consider an upgrade, but for now, if you have similar specs to the PS5 (look it up or ask Mason), you shouldn’t have any problem playing GTA VI on a PC equivalent to the PS5.</p>
    <p>If you have a 1080p monitor and specs similar to the PS5, you should be perfectly fine playing GTA VI. If you have a 1440p monitor, you might want to consider an upgrade if you want perfect graphics, but overall it’s playable on good settings, so you’re perfectly fine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Unfortunately, if you are on console, 30 FPS is the highest you are getting, no matter your screen.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is an assumption, as PC requirements have not been fully released yet. I work too much over unnecessary things</p>
